# Python_Random_Data 

This is a program that gives us an x amount of clients (chose by us) in a determined period of time (In this case years) 
The user will have the possibility to choose the data he/she wants to visualize.

### Aim
This program was used to create the database of the fictional company 'Kaixin S.A'. 
The aim of this project is to acquire information that we don't have and put it into a spreadsheet, Excel for example, if we want it and then be able to analyze the data with a data visualization tool (In my case 'Tableau').
## Mentions

I want to say that this project was built by me except by just one file that was acquired from another user of GitHub which provides to the community a list of Surnames (In this case I used a list of Surnames from the UK). The link and the user will be bellow, thank you!
